# Game-of-Life-3D-Edition
This is a 3D version of John Conway's Game of Life. I programmed this using Java and the Java Processing library created by the Processing Foundation. The programming environment used was the IntelliJ IDE. What makes this project so special is that it builds off of a very well-known simulation and turns it into something more modern, something that aligns with the overwhelming usage of 3D graphics. In order to make the standard Game of Life 3D, I had to modify the original rules of the simulation so that it would work in a third dimension. After some trial and error, I was able to find a set of rules that work somewhat well in 3D.
